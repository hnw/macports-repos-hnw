description           Handy web browsing in a Perl object
long_description      This module provides a quick, convenient way of \
                      bootstrapping a user-local Perl module library located \
                      within the user's home directory. It also constructs \
                      and prints out for the user the list of environment \
                      variables using the syntax appropriate for the user's \
                      current shell (as specified by the SHELL environment \
                      variable), suitable for directly adding to one's shell \
                      configuration file. More generally, local::lib allows \
                      for the bootstrapping and usage of a directory \
                      containing Perl modules outside of Perl's @INC. \
                      This makes it easier to ship an application with an \
                      app-specific copy of a Perl module, or collection of \
                      modules. Useful in cases like when an upstream \
                      maintainer hasn't applied a patch to a module of \
                      theirs that you need for your application.
